  title: DCSA OpenAPI specification for Just in Time Portcalls
  version: 1.2.0-Beta-1
  description: "API specification issued by DCSA.org\r\n\r\nThis API supports **JIT** v1.2 (Just in Time Portcalls). JIT is used for negotiating timestamps between vessel and port/terminal and other services providers. To create a new timestamp the `POST /v1/timestamps` endPoint is to be used.\r\n\r\nFor explanation to specific values or objects please refer to the [Information Model 2022.2 - **to be updated in July**].\r\n\r\nThis API does not define the business rules regarding what is allowed to update at what time. For this the [Just in Time Portcall IFS v1.2](https://dcsa.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/#2o000000YvHJ/a/7T000000Db84/Rp.tknLWVuS79ZXmWUU_IXgexNiFXgSJExKnNPv5si8) should be consulted.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to use this API as a standalone API. In order to do so it is necessary to use the poll-endPoint `GET /v1/events` in order to pull event information.\r\n\r\nIt is recomended to implement the [DCSA Just in Time Portcalls (JIT) Event Hub v1.2](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dcsaorg/JIT_EVENT_HUB/1.2.0-Beta-1) in order to use the push model. Here events are pushed as they occur.\r\n\r\nFor a changelog please click [here](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI/tree/master/jit/v1#v120B1). Please also [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI/issues/new) if you have any questions/comments.\r\n\r\nFor an example of an implementation of this API please check the [JIT Reference Implementation](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-JIT).\r\n\r\n[Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA) - Website](https://dcsa.org/)"
