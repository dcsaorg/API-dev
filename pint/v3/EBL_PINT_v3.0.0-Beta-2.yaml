    <h1>DCSA OpenAPI specification for electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) Platform Interoperability (PINT) standard </h1>

    <h2>The Envelope Transfer</h2>

    The PINT API is designed to support non-repudiable transfer of eBL document and any number of additional documents between two eBL platforms. 

    In the most common scenario, the sending eBL platform executes the envelope transfer by:
    1. Initiating the envelope transfer using [**'Start envelope transfer'**](#/Start%20envelope%20transfer) endpoint
    2. Transfering the additional documents (one at the time) using [**'Transfer additional document'**](#/Transfer%20additional%20document) endpoint
    3. Completing the envelope transfer using [**'Finish envelope transfer'**](#/Finish%20envelope%20transfer) endpoint

    <h2>The eBL document</h2>

    The envelope transfer from the sending eBL Platform to the receiving eBL Platform always contains the **eBL document** (transferred via [**'Start envelope transfer'**](#/Start%20envelope%20transfer) endpoint request body [`EblEnvelope.transportDocument`](#/EblEnvelope) schema object). The eBL document must be unchanged between different envelope transfers for the lifetime of the eBL document. 

    The PINT API is designed to support transfer of the following types of eBL documents:
    1. Straight eBL documents. This type of eBL document is defined by [`EblEnvelope.transportDocument.isToOrder`](#/EblEnvelope) attribute to `false`
    2. Blank-endorsed eBL documents. This type of eBL document is created by setting [`EblEnvelope.transportDocument.isToOrder`](#/EblEnvelope) attribute to `true`, and making sure that [`EblEnvelope.transportDocument.documentparties[]`](#/EblEnvelope) list does not contain document party where `DocumentParty.partyFunction` has value `END` (Endorsee)
    3. To-order/Negotiable eBL documents. This type of eBL document is created by setting the [`EblEnvelope.transportDocument.isToOrder`](#/EblEnvelope) attribute to `true`, and making sure that [`EblEnvelope.transportDocument.documentparties[]`](#/EblEnvelope) list contains document party where `DocumentParty.partyFunction` has value `END` (Endorsee). If the current endorsee party is also in possession of the eBL (possessor), this party can endorse some other party on the same eBL Platform (and make that other party new endorsee) by executing transaction with [`Transaction.action`](#/Transaction) type `ENDO` (Endorsement). IMPORTANT: To-order eBL workflows are still not fully supported in this version of PINT API.

    <h2>The Additional Documents</h2>

    The envelope transfer can optionally contain one or more **additional documents** which can be transferred via [**'Transfer additional document'**](#/Transfer%20additional%20document) endpoint:
    - **'Digital copy of the original physical B/L document' document** (described via [`EnvelopeManifest.eBLVisualisationByCarrier`](#/EnvelopeManifest) schema object that has been previously transferred via [**'Start envelope transfer'**](#/Start%20envelope%20transfer) endpoint as JWS-signed payload of [`EblEnvelope.envelopeManifestSignedContent`](#/EblEnvelope) schema object) a.k.a. **eBLVisualisationByCarrier document**. If transferred with the initial eBL envelope transfer, eBLVisualisationByCarrier document must be transferred with every subsequent envelope transfer for the lifetime of the eBL document. Also, eBLVisualisationByCarrier document must be unchanged between different envelope transfers for the lifetime of the eBL document.
    - **Supporting document** (described via entry in the [`EnvelopeManifest.supportingDocuments[]`](#/EnvelopeManifest) list object that has been previously transferred via [**'Start envelope transfer'**](#/Start%20envelope%20transfer) endpoint  as JWS-signed payload of [`EblEnvelope.envelopeManifestSignedContent`](#/EblEnvelope) schema object). For every envelope transfer, the sending platform can choose which supporting documents it wants to send to the receiving platform irrespective of the contents of the previously received envelope transfer. All details of the supporting documents transferred from sending to receiving platform as a part of the envelope transfer are only privy to these 2 platforms.

    <h2>Non-repudiation</h2>

    When receiving [**'Start envelope transfer'**](#/Start%20envelope%20transfer) endpoint request, the receiving platform should confirm the integrity of the received [`EblEnvelope`](#/EblEnvelope) schema object for non-repudiation purposes. Since it has been decided not to use JWS for signing of [`EblEnvelope`](#/EblEnvelope) (for network traffic optimization purposes) itself, the receiving platform can confirm the integrity of the envelope data by confirming integrity of the [`EblEnvelope.envelopeManifestSignedContent`](#/EblEnvelope) JWS-signed payload [`EnvelopeManifest`](#/EnvelopeManifest), and then use contents of [`EnvelopeManifest`](#/EnvelopeManifest) schema object to confirm the integrity of the other [`EblEnvelope`](#/EblEnvelope) schema object attributes (further details can be found in the description of [`EblEnvelope`](#/EblEnvelope) schema attributes).

    At various stages during the envelope transfer process, the receiving platform can inform the sending platform whether envelope transfer has been accepted or rejected by sending the final response using the [`EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse`](#/EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse) schema object which has been wrapped in JWS-signed response [`EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponseSignedContent`](#/EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponseSignedContent) schema object for non-repudiation purposes. All other response schema types are unsigned, and therefore they can not be used by the sending platform for the non-repudiation purposes.

    ### Stats API

            The signed response [`EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponseSignedContent`](#/EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponseSignedContent) JWS-signed payload must contain [`EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse.responseCode`](#/EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse) that signals the accepted envelope transfer (`RECE` or `DUPE`).

            If the sending platform attempts to start a new envelope transfer for an eBL that already has the active envelope transfer that is not yet completed, the receiving platform should assume that the sending platform is retrying the envelope transfer. The receiving platform should assume that the sending platform is aware that the previous envelope transfer failed or that the sending platform is not aware that the previous envelope transfer started.

            The [`EnvelopeTransferStartedResponse`](#/EnvelopeTransferStartedResponse) response is unsigned. The sending platform is required to finish the envelope transfer via [**'Finish envelope transfer'**](#/Finish%20envelope%20transfer) endpoint in order to get a signed response [`EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponseSignedContent`](#/EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponseSignedContent) with the JWS-signed payload `EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse` carrying the information whether the receiving platform has accepted or rejected the envelope transfer.

            In the rare corner cases, the unsigned `error` response could come from middleware and hide a true envelope transfer acceptance/rejection message. The sending platform will be liable if they act on an unsigned reponse that does *not* match the actions of the receiving platform.

        Transfer **additional document** associated with an eBL envelope transfer. The transfered document should be either one of the **supporting documents** from the [`EnvelopeManifest.supportingDocuments`](#/EnvelopeManifest) list, or **eBLVisualisationByCarrier document** if attribute [`EnvelopeManifest.eBLVisualisationByCarrier`](#/EnvelopeManifest) was defined.

        The `requestBody` should contain the document being transferred. It is recommended to use the `application/json` media type for the `requestBody`. The media type provided in the initial `ISSU` (Issuance) transaction is the one that will be associated with the transferred additional document in the end.

        The receiving platform should check that the transferred document has been declared at the start of the eBL envelope transfer.
        This should be done by verifying that the `documentChecksum` URL path parameter matches either [`EnvelopeManifest.eBLVisualisationByCarrier.documentChecksum`](#/EnvelopeManifest) attribute value (in which case the receiving platform can conclude that the sending platform has transferred the **eBLVisualisationByCarrier document**), or one of the [`DocumentMetadata.documentChecksum`](#/DocumentMetadata) values from the [`EnvelopeManifest.supportingDocuments[]`](#/EnvelopeManifest) list (in which case the receiving platform can conclude that the sending platform has transferred the **supporting document**)
         
        Furthermore, the receiving platform should compute the SHA-256 checksum of the transferred additional document, and verify that it matches the value of `documentChecksum` URL path parameter. The SHA-256 checksum MUST be calculated based on the deserialized payload.

        If all the above mentioned verifications have been successfull, the receiving platform can conclude that the additional document was transferred successfully.

            The receiving platform is required to validate that all the list entries are present, valid, and they are correctly ordered by:
            1. Computing the SHA-256 checksum of the last [`EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContent`](#/EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContent) entry in the `envelopeTransferChain[]` list, and confirming it's equal to received `EblEnvelope.envelopeManifestSignedContent` JWS-signed payload [`EnvelopeManifest.lastEnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContentChecksum`](#/EnvelopeManifest) attribute value. 
            2. Walking back through the `envelopeTransferChain[]` list from the last entry, for each previous [`EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContent`](#/EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContent) entry in the list, computing the SHA-256 checksum and confirming it's equal to the current [`EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContent`](#/EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContent) entry JWT-signed payload [`EnvelopeTransferChainEntry.previousEnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContentChecksum`](#/EnvelopeTransferChainEntry) attribute value.

            The receiving platform can reject the envelope with `BENV` [`responseCode`](#/EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse) if it concludes that the list entries are not correctly ordered by the sending platform, or discovers any other validity-related issue in the list.

            The first [`EnvelopeTransferChainEntry`](#/EnvelopeTransferChainEntry) in the `envelopeTransferChain[]` list should contain the ISSU (issuance) transaction as the first transaction in the [`EnvelopeTransferChainEntry.transactions[]`](#/EnvelopeTransferChainEntry) list.

            The response code can have one of the following values:

            - `MDOC` (Missing Document)
            - `DISE` (Disputed Envelope)

            The `RECE` `responseCode` is used when the receiving platform acknowledges that the envelope transfer is accepted. 
            This response code can also be used when replying to [**'Start envelope transfer'**](#/Start%20envelope%20transfer) endpoint request if and only if the receiving platform is already in possesion of all the additional documents listed in the `EnvelopeManifest`, and is ready to commit to accepting the envelope transfer.  This should only happen in special cases (e.g. Platform A which has performed the intial envelope transfer with additional documents to platform B later during the lifetime of the same eBL receives [**'Start envelope transfer'**](#/Start%20envelope%20transfer) endpoint request from some other Platform C with `EnvelopeManifest` listing additional documents, for which it concludes (based on checksum comparison) that they are identical to the addition documents from the intial envelope transfer). The `RECE` `responseCode` should be used together with the HTTP `200 Ok` response status code.

            The `DUPE` `responseCode` is used in place of `RECE` `responseCode` when the receiving platform has already previously acknowledged and accepted the transfer of this envelope. In this case, the receiving platform asserts that this envelope transfer request is invalid but the prior envelope transfer was successful.  The receiving platform should include accepted version of last `EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContent` entry in `EblEnvelope.envelopeTransferChain` list in the `duplicateOfAcceptedEnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContent` field. The receiving platform is only required to detect DUPE `responseCode` if the EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContentChecksum is the same between the two transfer attempt and the sending platform is expected to reuse the same envelope. The `DUPE` `responseCode` should be used together with the HTTP `200 Ok` response status code.

            The `BSIG` `responseCode` is used when the receiving platform could not process the envelope related to a signature and rejects the concrete transfer request. This response code should be used when the receiving platform decides to reject envelope transfer due to the issues with the signature used to create JWS content when starting envelope transfer (`EblEnvelope.envelopeManifestSignedContent`, and/or one or more `EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContentChecksum` entries in the `EblEnvelope.envelopeTransferChain` list). Example use cases: the signature was made by an unknown key, the key or signature expired, the signed content does not match the EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContentChecksum, etc. In this case, the receiving platform makes no assertions about the validity of the envelope contents. The sending platform may attempt to resolve the signature issue and retry with the same EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContentChecksum. The `BSIG` `responseCode` should be used together with a HTTP `422 Unprocessable Content` response status code.

            The `BENV` `responseCode` is used when the receiving platform can not process the envelope and rejects the concrete envelope transfer request. This response code can be used when the receiving platform knows the transfer cannot succeed in the future and the sending platform should retain the eBL. Example use cases could be that the envelope does not list the receiving platform as the intended recipient, the transferee ID is unknown, an invalid action code was used in the transactions for this envelope transfer, etc. In this case, the receiving platform is asserting that the envelope itself is not acceptable. Basically any use case where the receiving platform decides to reject the envelope transfer for technical reasons that are not covered by `BSIG` `responseCode`. The `BENV` `responseCode` should be used together with a HTTP `422 Unprocessable Content` response status code.

            The `INCD` `responseCode` is used when the receiving platform concludes that the transferred additional document's checksum or size does not match the document checksum or size provided either directly in URL path or in `EnvelopeManifest` sent in the start envelope transfer request. The `INCD` `responseCode` does *not* reject the envelope transfer. The sending platform should try to either resend the correct document, or attempt to start new envelope transfer request with changed `EnvelopeManifest` that will contain correct document checksum and/or size for the inconclusive document. The `INCD` `responseCode` is not valid as a response to the start of a envelope transfer.  The `INCD` `responseCode` should be used together with a HTTP `409 Conflict` response status code.

            The `MDOC` `responseCode` is used when the receiving platform cannot accept the envelope transfer due to a missing additional document.  The `MDOC` `responseCode` does *not* reject the envelope transfer. The sending platform should resend relevant documents (provided in `missingAdditionalDocumentChecksums`) and then retry finishing the envelope transfer. The `MDOC` `responseCode` is not valid as a response to the start of a envelope transfer.  The `MDOC` `responseCode` should be used together with a HTTP `409 Conflict` response status code.

            The `DISE` `responseCode` is used when the receiving platform has successfully parsed the envelope and validated the signatures.  However, the receiving platform believes the envelope contradicts its current knowledge of the envelope transfer chain for the eBL document and there is a risk of double spending. The concrete detection method is implementation-specific. However, a method would be for the receiving platform to confirm whether it has `EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContentChecksum` for the document, which are not listed in the transferred eBL envelope. Dispute resolution is not covered in the API and must be handled in via out of band process. The `DISE` `responseCode` should be used together with the HTTP `409 Conflict` response status code.

            Unless otherwise stated for a given response code, receiving platform will reject the active envelope transfer (if any). Some failures that result in receiving platform rejecting the envelope transfer may be retriable, in which case the sending platform can attempt a new envelope transfer for the same envelope.

            The sending platform must not rely on the HTTP response status code alone as it is not covered by the signature. When there is a mismatch between the HTTP response status code and the signed response `EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponseSignedResponse` JWS-signed payload [`EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse.responseCode`](#/EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse), [`responseCode`](#/EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse) decides the outcome.

    Transaction:
      type: object
      properties:
        action:
          type: string
          description: |
            Action denotes the transaction type, which can have one of the following values:
            - `ISSU` (Issuance)
            - `TRNS` (Transfer of possession)
            - `ENDO` (Endorsement a.k.a. Transfer of title)
            - `RESD` (Request to surrender for delivery)
            - `RESA` (Request to surrender for amendment)
            - `SACC` (Surrender accepted)
            - `SREJ` (Surrender rejected)

            The `ISSU` `action` is used for the eBL issuance transaction from the carrier party to the shipper party, and must appear exactly once in the first transaction of the first [`EnvelopeTransferChainEntry`](#/EnvelopeTransferChainEntry) entry (as JWS payload of [`EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContent`](#/EnvelopeTransferChainEntrySignedContent) entry) in the [`EblEnvelope.envelopeTransferChain`](#/EblEnvelope) list. If the eBL document is issued to the shipper party that resides on the different eBL Platform from the carrier's platform, initial envelope transfer should contain envelope transfer chain where first entry's first transaction has `ISSU` `action` type. 

            The `TRNS` `action` is used for the transfer of possession of the eBL from the current possessor party to the new possessor party.

            The `ENDO` `action` is used for the endorsement (a.k.a. transfer of title, or the right to take the delivery of the goods) of To-order eBL documents, where the new endorsee party is not named in the eBL document. The endorsement should always happen on the platform of the user that is not only the current endorsee, but also the current possessor of the eBL document. If the new endorsee party resides on the different eBL Platform from the current endorsee's platform, the envelope transfer process is used to notify the new endorsee of the `ENDO` `action` transaction for non-repudiation purposes, and will NOT result in the transfer of possession of the eBL documment contained in the envelope. 

            If the party is the current possessor, and the party is the current consignee/endorsee/shipper (or eBL document is blank-endorsed), the party may request to surrender the eBL to the carrier. This is done by using one of the Request to surrender action types (`RESD` `action` or `RESA` `action`) and with the issuing carrier or the relevant carrier agent as the `recipient` of the action. 
             
             The `RESD` `action` is used when the party wants to request the delivery of the goods. If the request is accepted (for details see `SACC` `action`), the carrier and the party submitting the surrender request will negotiate how the goods will be delivered (e.g. via DCSA shipment release API).
             
             The `RESA` `action` is used when the party wants to surrender the eBL document, so that the carrier can issue an amended eBL document. If the request is accepted (for details see `SACC` `action` resonse), the alignment on the exact change(s) that need to be made to the eBL document is done outside of the PINT API (e.g. via the DCSA EBL API). If the request is accepted, the existing eBL document is voided along with its envelope transfer chain, and the amended eBL document must be reissued with a new envelope transfer chain (for details see the `ISSU` `action` type description paragraph above). The `RESA` `action` is also used for switch to paper as the DCSA process flow for switching to paper is part of the amendment process (e.g. to note how many originals and copies with and without charges should be issued).

            If a surrender request (`RESD` `action` or `RESA` `action`) is not addressed to the carrier that issued the eBL document or to their legal representative, then the receiving platform should reject the envelope transfer with the [`EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse`](#/EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse) containing `BENV` [`responseCode`](#/EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse).

            The `SACC` `action` is used by the carrier to asynchronously accept the surrender request initiated via `RESD` `action` or `RESA` `action`. If the party that submitted the surrender request is on the different platform, the envelope transfer process is used to notify the (surrender request submitter) party of the `SACC` `action` transaction for non-repudiation purposes, and will NOT result in the transfer of possession of the eBL documment contained in the envelope. No transactions may occur after a `SACC` `action` transaction. Any envelope transfer chain changes with new transactions after a `SACC` `action` transaction are invalid and should be answered with the [`EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse`](#/EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse) containing `BENV` [`responseCode`](#/EnvelopeTransferFinishedResponse). 

            The `SREJ` `action` is used by the carrier to asynchronously reject the surrender request initiated via `RESD` `action` or `RESA` `action`, and return the eBL document possession to the party that submitted the surrender request.

            When the transaction recipient is residing on the different platform from the transaction actor's platform, the transaction should be followed by the envelope transfer from the actor's (sending) platform to the recipient's (receiving) platform. If the envelope transfer is caused by either `ENDO` `action` or `SACC` `action` transaction (where the recipient is on the different platform), the envelope transfer process is NOT causing transfer of possession of the eBL document, but is merely used as notificaiton for the non-repudiation purposes.
