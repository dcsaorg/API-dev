### Track & Trace (T&T)

The DCSA Interface Standard for Track and Trace is documented on the [**DCSA TNT**](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dcsaorg/DCSA_TNT) SwaggerHub.

The purpose of an Event Hub is to send events and manage subscriptions. Track & Trace is a specialised Hub managing:
- `TransportEvents` - events regarding transportation (Arrival and Departure)
- `EquipmentEvents` - events regarding Equipment (Loading, Discharging, Gated in, Gate out, Stuffing, Stripping)
- `ShipmentEvents` - events regarding documentation (Booking, Bill of Lading, Arrival Notice, Shipment Release Message)

It is only possible to **receive** and **subscribe** to events mentioned above when implementing Track & Trace.
