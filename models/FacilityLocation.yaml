description: |
  An interface used to express a location using a `Facility`. The facility can either be expressed using a `BIC` code or a `SMDG` code. The `facilityCode` does not contain the `UNLocationCode` - this should be provided in the `UnLocationCode` attribute.
properties:
  locationName:
    type: string
    description: The name of the location.
    pattern: ^\S+(\s+\S+)*$
    example: Port of Amsterdam
    maxLength: 100

      Discriminator used to identify this as a `Facility Location` interface
    example: FACI
  UNLocationCode:
    description: |-
      The UN Location code specifying where the place is located. The pattern used must be

       - 2 characters for the country code using [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)
       - 3 characters to code a location within that country. Letters A-Z and numbers from 2-9 can be used

      More info can be found here: [UN/LOCODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN/LOCODE)

      This field is **conditionally mandatory** depending on the value of the `facilityCodeListProvider` field.
  facilityCode:
    type: string
    pattern: ^\S+(\s+\S+)*$
    maxLength: 6
    description: |-
      The code used for identifying the specific facility. This code does not include the UN Location Code.

      The definition of the code depends on the `facilityCodeListProvider`. As code list providers maintain multiple codeLists the following codeList is used:

      - for `SMDG` - the codeList used is the [SMDG Terminal Code List](https://smdg.org/wp-content/uploads/Codelists/Terminals/SMDG-Terminal-Code-List-v20210401.xlsx) 
      - for `BIC` - the codeList used is the [BIC Facility Codes](https://www.bic-code.org/facility-codes/)
    nullable: false
    example: ADT
  facilityCodeListProvider:
    type: string
    description: |
      The provider used for identifying the facility Code. Some facility codes are only defined in combination with an `UN Location Code`
      - BIC (Requires a UN Location Code)
      - SMDG (Requires a UN Location Code)
    enum:
      - BIC
      - SMDG
    example: SMDG
required:
  - locationType
  - facilityCode
  - facilityCodeListProvider
