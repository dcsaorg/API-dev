    DCSA OpenAPI specification for Issuance an EBL to an EBL platform.
  description: |
    This API is intended as an API between a carrier (the client) and a EBL Solution Platform (the server).

    This API is a counter part to the [DCSA OpenAPI specification for responding to an issuance request](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL_ISS_RSP/3.0.0-Beta-2) API.

    When the document is to be surrendered, it should happen via a version of the [DCSA EBL Surrender](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL_SUR/3.0.0-Beta-2) API.

    API specification issued by DCSA.org.

    ### Stats API
    The Stats API offers crucial statistical information for both API providers and consumers to enhance their services and helps DCSA to understand and scale the ecosystem. We expect you to invoke the Stats API for every request made to this API. Further details can be found [here](https://labs.dcsa.org/#/http/guides/api-guides/stats-api/introduction)

            Platform acknowledges the issuance request and will follow up later with a response via the DCSA_ISS_RSP API. Please see the API description for the concrete link and version.

            Note that the platform MUST NOT accept an issuance request twice. If the client misbehaves and attempts to complete the same transaction more than once, then the platform must ensure that at most one of these requests sees a successful response.  The rest should an error instead.

            An Issuance Request is made with a Transport Document Reference (TDR), that was used previously to request the issuance of a Transport Document (TD). The document is either already issued or an TD with the same TDR. 

            The eBL platform will inform the carrier when the carrier needs to act on this document again. If the issuance is pending, then the carrier will be notified via the DCSA_EBL_ISS_RSP API once the issuance process completes. If the issuance has already succeeded, the eBL platform will notify the carrier when there is a surrender request via the DCSA_EBL_SUR API.
