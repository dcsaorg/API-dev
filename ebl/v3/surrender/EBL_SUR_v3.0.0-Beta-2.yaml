  title: DCSA EBL Surrender API
  description: |
    This API is intended as an API between a carrier (the server) and a EBL Solution Platform (the client).

    The EBL Solution Platform will submit surrender requests to the carrier, which will be processed asynchronously. Responses to the surrender reqests will be submitted by the carrier via the [DCSA_EBL_SUR_RSP](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL_SUR_RSP/3.0.0-Beta-2) API.

    When the platform submits a surrender request, the platform guarantees *all* of the following:

    1) The surrender request was submitted by the sole possessor of the EBL.
    2) Depending on the eBL type:
       * For non-negoitable ("straight") eBLs, the surrender request was submitted by either the original shipper OR the consignee.
       * For negotiable eBLs with a named titleholder, the surrender request was submitted by the named titleholder.
       * For negotiable eBLs without a named titleholder / blank eBLs, possession is sufficient for the entity surrendering the eBL.
    3) The platform has the EBL in custody while the carrier is evaluating this surrender request. I.e., neither possession nor title holder changes can occur until the carrier responds to this surrender request.

    Please see the [Surrender Request](#/surrenderRequestDetails) for details on what data the platform will provide.

    ### Stats API
    The Stats API offers crucial statistical information for both API providers and consumers to enhance their services and helps DCSA to understand and scale the ecosystem. We expect you to invoke the Stats API for every request made to this API. Further details can be found [here](https://labs.dcsa.org/#/http/guides/api-guides/stats-api/introduction)

        Creates a Surrender Request

        The EBL Solution Platform uses this endpoint to submit a surrender request.

        The carrier's answer to the surrender request will be returned via a callback response (see the `Callbacks` tab)

            The surrender request code determines the type of surrender request. Any parallel negotiation between the consignee and the carrier related to any of these type surrender are handled outside this API. Examples could be the shipment release related to a surrender for delivery or the actual contents of the admendment in a surrender related to an amendment.

            Note that "Switch to paper" is considered an amendment in how it is modelled via the DCSA eBL data standard.
