  title: DCSA OpenAPI specification for Booking
  description: |
    API specification issued by DCSA.org.

    For explanation of specific values or objects please refer to the [Information Model 2024.Q1](https://dcsa-website.cdn.prismic.io/dcsa-website/ZhlC9TjCgu4jzyW5_20240402-DCSA-Information-Model-2024.Q1-ReleaseCandidate_01.pdf). This API specification does not define the allowable updates and their timing in accordance with the established business rules. Refer to the [DCSA Interface Standard for the Booking process 2.0 Beta 3](https://dcsa.org/standards/booking/documentation-booking-2-beta-3) to address this. **All use cases mentioned in this API specification refer to use cases defined in this Booking IFS**.

    All other documents related to the Booking publication can be found [here](https://dcsa.org/standards/booking-process/)

    It is possible to use the Booking API as a standalone API. In that case poll on the following endPoints:

        GET /v2/bookings/{bookingReference}

    in order to poll information about status changes.

    ### Notifications
    It is possible to have notifications pushed to you whenever the provider needs input and/or a state change. The format of the notification is defined by the [Booking Notification API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_BKG_NTF/2.0.0-Beta-3). Signing up for notifications is defined outside the scope of this API specification.

    ### Stats API
    The Stats API offers crucial statistical information for both API providers and consumers to enhance their services and helps DCSA to understand and scale the ecosystem. We expect you to invoke the Stats API for every request made to the Booking API. Further details can be found [here](https://labs.dcsa.org/#/http/guides/api-guides/stats-api/introduction)

        Creates a new booking request. This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 1 - Submit booking request**.

        **Needs to be updated**

        ## Precondition
        The consumer has information for a `Booking Request`

        ## Postcondition
        The provider has received the `Booking Request`. 

        The consumer will receive a `201` (Created) if the request payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.

        ## Flow
        The following occurs when a provider receives a `Booking Request`:

        1. The payload (`Booking Request`) is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.

           **The process stops here!**
        2. The payload is schema-valid which means
            - all required properties are provided
            - all values provided have correct data type.

            A `carrierBookingRequestReference` (as a reference to the `Booking Request`) is created and stored along with the payload in the provider system.
          
            **For the rest of this description and in all examples the value `cbrr-123` will be used as `carrierBookingRequestReference`**

        3. A `201` (Created) response is returned with the following payload
            ```
            {
              carrierBookingRequestReference: 'cbrr-123',
              bookingStatus: 'RECEIVED'
            }
            ```
        4. All '_relevant_' subscribers will be notified via a [Booking Notification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_BKG_NTF/2.0.0-Beta-3#/Notifications/booking-notifications).

        For `POST` `Booking Request` the process ends here. The `Booking Request`
          - is now stored in the provider system
          - has status `RECEIVED`
          - a `201` (Created) response is sent to the consumer with a payload containing `bookingStatus='RECEIVED'`
          - awaits further processing by the provider
          - '_relevant_' subscribers have been notified.

        The provider wil now start asynchronous processing. Once processed, the new status of the `Booking Request` will be communicated via a `Booking Notification`. In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the

            GET /v2/bookings/{bookingReference}
            
        endPoint to check if the `bookingStatus` of the `Booking Request` has changed.

        Updates the `Booking Request` with the `bookingReference`. The path can contain either a `carrierBookingRequestReference` or a `carrierBookingReference`. This endPoint corresponds with either
        - **UseCase 3 - Submit updated Booking request**
        - **UseCase 7 - Request amendments to confirmed Booking**

        This endPoint is to be used in response to
        - **UseCase 2 - Request to update Booking request**
        - **UseCase 6 - Request to amend confirmed Booking**

        the endPoint can also be used in case `bookingStatus='RECEIVED'` and the consumer has an update to the `Booking Request`.

        ### Precondition
        In order to update a `Booking Request`, the status of the `Booking Request` needs to be in state
        - `RECEIVED` in case the consumer has updated information for the `Booking Request`
        - `PENDING UPDATE` in case the provider has requested the consumer to update the `Booking Request` (a result of **UseCase 2 - Request to update Booking request**)
        - `UPDATE RECEIVED` in case the consumer has additional changes to an already sent update
        - `PENDING AMENDMENT` in case the provider has requested the consumer to amend the `Booking Request` (a result of **UseCase 6 - Request to amend confirmed Booking**)
        - `CONFIRMED` in case the consumer has an amendment to the `Booking Request`

        ## Postcondition
        The provider has received an update (**UseCase 3 - Submit updated Booking request**) or an amendment (**UseCase 7 - Request amendments to confirmed Booking**) to the `Booking Request`.

        In case an amendment was received to the `Booking Request`(**UseCase 7 - Request to amend confirmed Booking**) - the amendment will be called `Amended Booking`. The `Amended Booking` and the "original" `Booking Request` will **co-exist** until a new amendment is submitted by the consumer (via **UseCase 7: Request amendments to confirmed Booking**) or until the provider requests an update (sets the `bookingStatus='PENDING AMENDMENT'` via **UseCase 6: Request to amend confirmed Booking**). If the `amendedBookingStatus` is present it always represents the latest version of an amendment received by the provider.

        The consumer will receive a `200` (OK) if the payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.

        ## Flow
        The following occurs when a provider receives an **update** to a `Booking Request`
        1. The payload (`Booking Request`) is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.

           **The process stops here!**
        2. The payload is schema-valid which means
           - all required properties are provided
           - all values provided have correct data type
          
           The updated `Booking Request` is stored in the provider system.

           **For the rest of this description and in all examples the value `cbrr-123` will be used as `carrierBookingRequestReference`**
        3. The response depends on which useCase is the reason for calling this endPoint (what the `bookingStatus` is):
            - If `bookingStatus` **is** `RECEIVED` then this endPoint is being used in addition to **UseCase 1 - Submit booking request**. In this case the consumer would like to make an update to an already sent `Booking Request` - this is done via **UseCase 3 - Submit updated Booking Request**. The `bookingStatus` now changes to `UPDATE RECEIVED`.
            
              A `200` (OK) response corresponding to the following payload is returned
              ```
              {
                carrierBookingRequestReference: 'cbrr-123',
                bookingStatus: 'UPDATE RECEIVED'
              }
              ```
            - If `bookingStatus` is `PENDING UPDATE` then this endPoint is being used as a reponse to **UseCase 2 - Request to update Booking request** in this case the provider has requested an update to a `Booking Request`.  The `bookingStatus` now changes to `UPDATE RECEIVED`.

              A `200` (OK) response corresponding to the following payload is returned
              ```
              {
                carrierBookingRequestReference: 'cbrr-123',
                bookingStatus: 'UPDATE RECEIVED'
              }
              ```
            - If `bookingStatus` is `UPDATE RECEIVED` then this endPoint is being used to update an already sent update. The `bookingStatus` stays as `UPDATE RECEIVED`.

              A `200` (OK) response corresponding to the following payload is returned
              ```
              {
                carrierBookingRequestReference: 'cbrr-123',
                bookingStatus: 'UPDATE RECEIVED'
              }
              ```
            - If `bookingStatus` is `PENDING AMENDMENT` then this endPoint is being used as a response to **UseCase 6 - Request to amend Confirmed Booking**, in this case the provider has requested an amendment to a `Confirmed Booking`. The `bookingStatus` stays `PENDING AMENDMENT` and `amendedBookingStatus` is set to `AMENDMENT RECEVIED`.
            
              A `200` (OK) response corresponding to the following payload is returned
              ```
              {
                carrierBookingReference: 'cbr-987',
                carrierBookingRequestReference: 'cbrr-123',
                bookingStatus: 'PENDING AMENDMENT',
                amendedBookingStatus: 'AMENDMENT RECEIVED'
              }
              ```
            - If `bookingStatus` is `CONFIRMED` then this endPoint is being used in order to request an amendment to a `Confirmed Booking` this is done via **UseCase 7 - Request Amendments to Confirmed Booking**. The `bookingStatus` stays `CONFIRMED` and `amendedBookingStatus` is set to `AMENDMENT RECEIVED`.
            
              A `200` (OK) response corresponding to the following payload is returned
              ```
              {
                carrierBookingReference: 'cbr-987',
                carrierBookingRequestReference: 'cbrr-123',
                bookingStatus: 'CONFIRMED',
                amendedBookingStatus: 'AMENDMENT RECEIVED'
              }
              ```
        4. All '_relevant_' subscribers will be notified via a [Booking Notification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_BKG_NTF/2.0.0-Beta-3#/Notifications/booking-notifications).

        For `PUT` `Booking Request` the process ends here. The `Booking Request`
          - is now stored in the provider system
          - a `200` (OK) response is sent to the consumer with the status of the `Booking` (and possibly also with the `amendedBookingStatus`) with one of the following values (depending on the useCase):
            - `bookingStatus='UPDATE RECEIVED'` (if endPoint used before a `Booking`has been confirmed)
            - `bookingStatus='PENDING AMENDMENT'` and `amendedBookingStatus='AMENDMENT RECEIVED'` (if endPoint used as a response to **UseCase 6 - Request to amend Confirmed Booking**)
            - `bookingStatus='CONFIRMED'` and `amendedBookingStatus='AMENDMENT RECEIVED'` (if consumer is requesting an amendment to a `Confirmed Booking`)
          - awaits further processing by the provider
          - '_relevant_' subscribers have been notified.

        The provider wil now start asynchronous processing. Once processed, the new status of the `Booking` and `Amended Booking Request` will be communicated via a `Booking Notification`. In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the
            GET /v2/bookings/{bookingReference}
            
        endPoint to check if the `bookingStatus` and `amendedBookingStatus` of the `Booking` has changed.
          
        If the consumer wants to get the content of the `Amended Booking` provided via this `PUT` endPoint, the `GET` endPoint needs to be used in combination with the `?amendedContent=true` queryParameter:
            GET /v2/bookings/{bookingReference}?amendedContent=true

        It is possible to `GET` the content of the `Amended Booking` via the example above until either:

        - the provider requests for a new amendment (**UseCase 6: Request to amend confirmed Booking**) in which case the "old update" is no longer accessible
        - the consumer submits a new update (**UseCase 7: Request amendment to confirmed Booking**) in which case the "new amendment" provided **replaces** the "old amendment".

            The `Booking request` has been successfully updated in the provider systemwith one of the following combinations (depending on the use case):

        Retrieves the `Booking Request` with the `bookingReference`. The path can contain a `carrierBookingRequestReference` or a `carrierBookingReference`. It is recommended to use this endPoint to `GET` data before an update is made to make sure latest version is being updated.

        The default payload when calling this endPoint is the "original" `Booking`. It is also possible to get the latest amendment to a `Booking` called the `Amended Booking`. In order to get the `Amended Booking`, it is necessary to use the query parameter `amendedContent` and set it to `true`.
            GET /v2/bookings/{bookingReference}?amendedContent=true

        The `status` of the "original" `Booking` is included in both payloads as `bookingStatus`. `amendedBookingStatus` and related content is only available after the provider has approved the `Booking` via **UseCase 5: Confirm Booking request** and until:
        - the provider requests for a new amendment (**UseCase 6: Request to amend confirmed Booking**) in which case the "old update" is no longer accessable.
        - the consumer submits a new amendment (**UseCase 7: Request amendment to confirmed Booking**) in which case the "new update" provided **replaces** the "old update".
        - the provider re-confirms the `Booking` (**UseCase 5: Confirm booking request**) in which case the "old update" is no longer accessable.

        If `amendedContent=true` is requested but no amendment has yet been provided by the consumer **or** the state of the "original" `Booking` is `PENDING AMENDMENT`, then a `404` (Not Found) is returned.

        If the provider is requesting some changes to the `Booking` this will also be part of the "original" `Booking` payload in the `requestedChanges` property. This property is **conditional** on the `bookingStatus='PENDING UPDATE'` (in case the `Booking` has not yet been confirmed) or `bookingStatus='PENDING AMENDMENT'` (in case it is a confirmed `Booking`).

        In case no subscription (`Notification`) has been set up - it is possible to use this endPoint to poll on in order to detect if `bookingStatus` and/or `amendedBookingStatus` has changed.

        Cancels the Booking or cancels a Booking Amendment
      operationId: cancel-booking
      description: |
        A shipper initiated cancellation of the `Booking` or `Booking Amendment`. This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 11 - Cancel Booking by shipper** or **UseCase 9 - Cancel amendment to confirmed Booking**.

        ## Precondition
        In order to cancel a `Booking`, the `bookingStatus` must be either
        - `RECEIVED`
        - `PENDING UPDATE`
        - `UPDATE RECEIVED`
        - `CONFIRMED`
        - `PENDING AMENDMENT`

        In order to cancel a `Booking Amendment`, the status of the `Booking Amendment` must be
        - `AMENDMENT RECEIVED`

        ## Postcondition
        The provider has received a cancellation from the consumer for a `Booking` or for a `Booking Amendment`.

        The consumer will receive a `200` (OK) if the payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.

        ## Flow
        The following occurs when a provider receives a cancellation request:
        1. The payload is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.

           **The process stops here!**
        2. The payload is schema-valid which means:
           - all required properties are provided.
           - all values provided have correct data type.
        3. Depending on the paylod of the request - either:
           - the entire `Booking` is cancelled (including any ongoing amendment). This is the case when the payload contains `bookingStatus='CANCELLED'`.
           
             When cancelling a `Booking` the `amendedBookingStatus` is set to `AMENDMENT CANCELLED`
           - only the amendment to the `Booking` is cancelled (in this case the `Booking` continues and `bookingStatus` stays unchanged). This is the case when the payload contains `amendedBookingStatus='AMENDMENT CANCELLED'`.
             
             **If** no amendment is being requested prior to this call (`amendedBookingStatus` is **not** `AMENDMENT RECIEVED`) then a 404 (Not Found) is returned
        4. All '*relevant*' subscribers will be notified via a [Booking Notification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_BKG_NTF/2.0.0-Beta-3#/Notifications/booking-notifications).

                        Setting the `bookingStatus` to `CANCELLED` cancels the entire `Booking` (also any ongoing amendment requests). The `Booking` will discontinue if the request is accepted by the provider.

                        Only possible value to set is `CANCELLED`.

                        Setting the `amendedBookingStatus` to `AMENDMENT CANCELLED` **only** cancels the amendment to the `Booking`. 

                        It is a precondition that the `amendedBookingStatus` **is** `AMENDMENT RECEIVED` in order to cancel it. If this is not the case a `404` (Not Found) error response should be returned.

                        Only possible value to set is `AMENDMENT CANCELLED`.

              If a container does not comply with [ISO 6346](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_6346), it is suggested to follow [Recommendation #2: Containers with non-ISO identification](https://smdg.org/documents/smdg-recommendations) from SMDG.

              The unique identifier for the equipment, which should follow the BIC ISO Container Identification Number where possible.

              According to [ISO 6346](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_6346), a container identification code consists of a 4-letter prefix and a 7-digit number (composed of a 3-letter owner code, a category identifier, a serial number, and a check-digit).

              If a container does not comply with [ISO 6346](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_6346), it is suggested to follow [Recommendation #2: Containers with non-ISO identification](https://smdg.org/documents/smdg-recommendations) from SMDG.
